Fun game to play with your friends when you're all together

// node server.js

Ideas for improvement
- make game modes maybe (in the future)
- being able to rejoin under the same name
- be able to send the link for the active game (game code in the URL maybe)
-  when the players leaves then the players leaves for real (leave button or the host is able to delete players)
